# noetica-research

Noetica Research is an independent research project
exploring the structure of meaning, phase, and relational order
across theory and computational implementation.

## Scope

This repository is **not** the paper itself.

- The full theoretical framework is described in the Zenodo paper.
- This repository serves as a space for:
  - experimental implementations
  - exploratory tools
  - applied prototypes
  - ongoing research notes

The purpose is to investigate how Noetica Theory behaves
when translated into computational systems.

## Applications / Demos

### 🎵 Noetica Metronome
A metronome application designed with a focus on **perception, bodily groove, and immersion**, rather than mere time-keeping.

This app explores how rhythmic perception changes through sound design and relational structure, as an applied experiment of Noetica Theory.
